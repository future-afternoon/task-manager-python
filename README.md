Task Editing: Enable users to edit existing tasks.
Task Deletion: Allow users to delete tasks.
Task Sorting: Implement sorting based on due date or priority.
Status Update: Allow users to mark tasks as in progress or completed.
Bonus Features:

User Authentication: Implement a basic login system to manage tasks for different users.
Data Persistence: Save tasks to a file/database so that they persist between program runs.
Notifications: Provide reminders for upcoming due dates or overdue tasks.
Graphical User Interface (GUI): Expand the project by creating a GUI using a library like Tkinter or PyQt.
Technologies/Libraries to Consider:

Python
File handling or SQLite for data storage
Optional: Tkinter/PyQt for GUI
This project not only helps you practice Python but also involves user input, file/database handling, and potentially GUI development. Feel free to modify or expand on this idea based on your interests and skill level!
